# Environment Details

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Instance ID | [i-008a32431a66bdb7c] |
| Region | [eu-north-1] |
| Public IP | [16.171.56.116] |
| Node.js Version | [v18.20.0] |
| App Name (PM2) | [myapp] |
| App Port | [8080] |

---

# Step 1: Install Node.js

- [x] Installed Node.js with `sudo dnf install -y nodejs`
- [x] `node -v` prints a version number

**My Node.js version:** `v18.20.0`

---

# Step 2: Create the Application

- [x] Created `~/app` and ran `npm init -y`
- [x] Installed `express`
- [x] Created `app.js` with `/` and `/health` routes

---

# Step 3: Install and Start PM2

## Screenshot 1 – PM2 List (Online)

```

```

![PM2 List Online](screenshots/01-pm2-list-online.png)

---

- [x] Installed PM2 globally with `sudo npm install -g pm2`
- [x] Created `ecosystem.config.js` setting `NODE_ENV=production` and `PORT=8080`
- [x] Started the app with `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js`
- [x] `pm2 list` shows `status: online`, restart count 0
- [x] `curl localhost:8080/health` returns `{"status":"healthy",...}`
- [x] `curl localhost:8080/` shows `"environment":"production"`

---

# Step 4: Configure the Application to Survive a Reboot

## Screenshot 2 – PM2 Startup Enabled

```

```

---

- [x] Ran `pm2 startup` and copied the printed `sudo env PATH=...` command
- [x] Ran that printed command
- [x] Ran `pm2 save` to persist the process list
- [x] `systemctl is-enabled pm2-ec2-user` prints `enabled`

---

# Step 5: Configure Nginx

- [x] Installed Nginx with `sudo dnf install -y nginx`
- [x] Created `/etc/nginx/conf.d/app.conf` proxying port 80 → 8080, marked `default_server`
- [x] Removed the stock `listen 80 default_server;` line from `nginx.conf`
- [x] `sudo nginx -t` passes
- [x] Enabled and started Nginx with `sudo systemctl enable --now nginx`

---

# Step 6: Test the Full Chain

## Screenshot 3 – Health Endpoint

```

```

![Health Endpoint](screenshots/03-health-endpoint.png)

---

- [ ] `curl localhost/health` on the instance returns `{"status":"healthy",...}`
- [ ] `curl http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/health` from my laptop returns the same
- [ ] `curl http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/` shows `"environment":"production"`

---

# Step 7: Verify Automatic Restart After a Crash

## Screenshot 5 – Crash Recovery

```

```

![Crash Recovery](screenshots/05-crash-recovery.png)

---

- [x] Noted the restart count in `pm2 list` before the crash
- [x] Ran `kill -9 $(pm2 pid myapp)`
- [x] `pm2 list` shows the restart count (`↺`) incremented and status back to `online`

---

# Step 8: Verify the Application Survives a Reboot

## Screenshot 4 – After Reboot

```
screenshots/04-after-reboot.png
```

![After Reboot](screenshots/04-after-reboot.png)

---

- [x] Ran `sudo reboot`
- [x] Waited ~60 seconds and reconnected
- [x] Without starting anything manually, `pm2 list` shows `myapp` online
- [x] `curl localhost/health` responds successfully

---
